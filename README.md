This is the GitHub repository for the "SizeAcross dataset: a global dataset of size spectra across aquatic ecosystems and taxonomic groups", which was generated in the ACROSS project, funded by "Advanced early career researchers project grant (Advanced ECR)"
in the Second call of SIBECOL ([Iberian Society of Ecology](https://www.sibecol.org/en/)) Projects for Early Career Researchers.

Dataset last updated: 14.02.2024

## Repository structure

This repository has the data, graphs and the code to reproduce the figures in the data article called "SizeAcross dataset: a global dataset of size spectra across aquatic ecosystems and trophic levels".


## Data structure

We compiled a comprehensive collection of size spectrum parameters (i.e. slope, intercept and linearity) across ecosystems and trophic levels. Data were acquired from two different sources: a classic literature review and an online survey. 

To be included in the SizeAcross dataset, all articles had to meet the following criteria: (1) field-based studies and hence experimental or theoretical works were excluded; (2) studies involving animal communities and hence primary producers were excluded unless they were part of a food web (e.g., phytoplankton-zooplankton-fish); and (3) studies based on individual body size measurements without relying on mean or maximum body size per species.

From these articles, we extracted size spectrum parameters (e.g., slope, intercept and linearity) directly from tables or by digitizing information from plots using WebPlotDigitizer software v.3.4 (Rohatgi 2020). For each article, we also extracted additional information related to geographic location, ecosystem type, taxonomic groups, sampling method and period (mainly month), size spectrum method, number of size classes and minimum and maximum size classes. If relevant data/information (e.g., size spectrum parameters, geographic coordinates) from an article were not available for inclusion in the SizeAcross dataset, we contacted the corresponding authors to request the missing information. 


## How to add more data

If you are have size spectrum data that follow the the criteria described above, please contact us and we can add your data to the SizeAcross dataset.
